# CLAUDE.md — sereno-app

> Generated from governance.md by [crag](https://crag.sh). Regenerate: `crag compile --target claude`



**Stack:** node, react, typescript
**Runtimes:** node

## Quality Gates

Run these in order before committing. Stop on first MANDATORY failure:

- `npm run lint`
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run lint:prettier`

## Rules

1. Read `governance.md` at the start of every session — it is the single source of truth.
2. Run all mandatory quality gates before committing.
3. If a gate fails, attempt an automatic fix (lint/format) with bounded retry (max 2 attempts). If it still fails, escalate to the user.
4. Never modify files outside this repository.
5. Never run destructive system commands (`rm -rf /`, `DROP TABLE`, force-push to main).
- Follow project commit conventions

## Security

- No hardcoded secrets — grep for sk_live, AKIA, password= before commit

## Tool Context

This project uses **crag** (https://crag.sh) as its governance engine. The `governance.md` file is the authoritative source. Run `crag audit` to detect drift and `crag compile --target all` to recompile all targets.
